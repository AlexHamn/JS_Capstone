# JS_Capstone
The JavaScript capstone project is about building a web application based on the Art Institute of Chicago API.
All data is preserved thanks to the external [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270).

> Website that allows users to view and like artworks, interacting with a remote API.
